/**
 * Annotation to mark performance tests. Performance tests will be run if the profile performance-tests or all-tests are enabled.
 * <p/>
 * Performance tests can be in the same package as unit tests. To mark a test as a performance test,
 * add the annotation @PerformanceTest to the class definition.
 * For example:
 * <p/>
 * {@literal @}PerformanceTest<br/>
 * public class MyPerformanceTest {<br/>
 *  ...<br/>
 * }
 * <p/>
 *  In general performance tests should have a time limit on them, but the time limit should be liberal enough to account
 *  for running on CI systems like GitHub actions, or the apache jenkins build.
