            In this session we will look at how streaming sensor data fits into a variety of (I)IoT analytics use cases, and how Apache Storm and Kafka fit into an overall architecture for large-scale streaming analytics. You will also learn how to leverage the highly accessible Arduino microcontroller platform to create low-cost sensor networks and stream data to Apache Storm for analysis in real time. Finally, we will give a live demonstration of sensor analysis using Kafka, Storm, and an out-of-the-box Arduino board (no soldering required!).

            The Yahoo Ad Manager Plus platform (YAM+) provides reports to advertisers on impressions, clicks, and conversions for their ad campaigns. Impressions and clicks are straightforward. Conversions require joining "action beacons" from advertisers with impressions and clicks from advertisements served by YAM+. A conversion is recorded if a user clicked on or was shown an advertisement associated with the campaign identified in the beacon. This presentation describes a storm topology that uses HBase and Druid to provide low-latency feedback to advertisers on the performance of their campaigns. It covers storm and HBase tuning that was needed to support this reporting at production scale.

            At Yahoo, we extensively use the Apache Storm distributed real-time computation platform at medium scale deployment. In this talk we overview a collection of recent developments at Yahoo enabling massive Storm scaling to an order of magnitude larger clusters. They include a resource aware scheduler, load-aware shuffle grouping, a stand-alone heart-beat server that reduces the load on ZooKeeper, compression of ZooKeeper data and using timestamps instead of whole data through ZooKeeper, and finally a new distributed cache mechanism to distribute large files required by bolts.

            Real-time streams are everywhere, but does Python have a good way of processing them? Until recently, there were no good options. A new open source project, streamparse, makes working with real-time data streams easy for Pythonistas. If you have ever wondered how to process 10,000 data tuples per second with Python -- while maintaining high availability and low latency -- this talk is for you.</p>

            ne of the most commonly asked questions about Storm is how to properly size and scale a cluster for a given use case. While there is no magic bullet when it comes to capacity planning for a Storm cluster, there are many operational and development techniques that can be applied to eek out the maximum throughput for a given application. In this session we’ll cover capacity planning, performance tuning and optimization from both an operational and development perspective. We will discuss the basics of scaling, common mistakes and misconceptions, how different technology decisions affect performance, and how to identify and scale around the bottlenecks in a Storm deployment.</p>

            This talk provides an overview of the open source Storm system for processing Big Data in realtime. The talk starts with an overview of the technology, including key components: Nimbus, Zookeeper, Topology, Tuple, Trident. The presentation then dives into the complex Big Data architecture in which Storm can be integrated. The result is a compelling stack of technologies including integrated Hadoop clusters, MPP, and NoSQL databases.

            The presentation then reviews real world use cases for realtime Big Data analytics. Social updates, in particular real-time news feeds on sites like Twitter and Facebook, benefit from Storm's capacity to process benefits from distributed logic of streaming. Another case study is financial compliance monitoring, where Storm plays a primary role in reducing the market data to a useable subset in realtime. In a final use case, Storm is crucial to collect rich operational intelligence, because it builds multidimensional stats and executes distributed queries.</p>

            Some of the biggest issues at the center of analyzing large amounts of data are query flexibility, latency, and fault tolerance. Modern technologies that build upon the success of "big data" platforms, such as Apache Hadoop, have made it possible to spread the load of data analysis to commodity machines, but these analyses can still take hours to run and do not respond well to rapidly-changing data sets.</p>

            <p>A new generation of data processing platforms -- which we call "stream architectures" -- have converted data sources into streams of data that can be processed and analyzed in real-time. This has led to the development of various distributed real-time computation frameworks (e.g. Apache Storm) and multi-consumer data integration technologies (e.g. Apache Kafka). Together, they offer a way to do predictable computation on real-time data streams.</p>

            <p>In this talk, we will give an overview of these technologies and how they fit into the Python ecosystem. This will include a discussion of current open source interoperability options with Python, and how to combine real-time computation with batch logic written for Hadoop. We will also discuss Kafka and Storm's alternatives, current industry usage, and some real-world examples of how these technologies are being used in production by Parse.ly today.</p>

            This talk was presented at the New York City Storm User Group hosted by Spotify on March 25, 2014.</p><p>
            This is the first time that a Spotify engineer has spoken publicly about their deployment and use cases for Storm! In this talk, Software Engineer Neville Li describes:
            <ul><li>
            Real-time features developed using Storm and Kafka including recommendations, social features, data visualization and ad targeting</li>

            <li>Architecture</li>

            <li>Production integration</li>

            <li>Best practices for deployment</li></ul></p>
            <p>Spotify is an exciting case study - users create 600 Gigabyte of data per day and 150 Gigabyte of data per day via different services. Every day 4 Terabyte of data is generated in Hadoop, a 700-node cluster running over 2.000 jobs per day. They currently have 28 Petabytes of storage, spread out over 4 data centres across the world.</p>

                                <div>
                                                        <p>Published on Dec 19, 2013</p>
                                <p>With the proliferation of data sources and growing user bases, the amount of data generated requires new ways for storage and processing. Hadoop opened new possibilities, yet it falls short of instant delivery. Adding stream processing using Nathan Marz's Storm, can overcome this delay and bridge the gap to real-time aggregation and reporting. On the Batch layer all master data is kept and is immutable. Once the base data is stored a recurring process will index the data. This process reads all master data, parses it and will create new views out of it. The new views will replace all previously created views. In the Speed layer data is stored not yet absorbed in the Batch layer. Hours of data instead of years of data. Once the data is indexed in the Batch layer the data can discarded in the Speed layer. The Query Service merges the data from the Speed and Batch layers. This talk focuses on the Lambda architecture, which combines multiple technologies to be able to process vast amounts of data, while still being able to react timely and report near real-time statistics.

            This talk provides an overview of the open source Storm system for processing Big Data in realtime. The talk starts with an overview of the technology, including key components: Nimbus, Zookeeper, Topology, Tuple, Trident. The presentation then dives into the complex Big Data architecture in which Storm can be integrated. The result is a compelling stack of technologies including integrated Hadoop clusters, MPP, and NoSQL databases.</p>
            <p>
            The presentation then reviews real world use cases for realtime Big Data analytics. Social updates, in particular real-time news feeds on sites like Twitter and Facebook, benefit from Storm's capacity to process benefits from distributed logic of streaming. Another case study is financial compliance monitoring, where Storm plays a primary role in reducing the market data to a useable subset in realtime. In a final use case, Storm is crucial to collect rich operational intelligence, because it builds multidimensional stats and executes distributed queries.</p>

            Storm makes it easy to write and scale complex realtime computations on a cluster of computers, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm guarantees that every message will be processed. And it's fast -- you can process millions of messages per second with a small cluster. Best of all, you can write Storm topologies using any programming language. Storm was open-sourced by Twitter in September of 2011 and has since been adopted by numerous companies around the world.</p><p>
            Storm provides a small set of simple, easy to understand primitives. These primitives can be used to solve a stunning number of realtime computation problems, from stream processing to continuous computation to distributed RPC. In this talk you'll learn:
            <ul>
            <li>The concepts of Storm: streams, spouts, bolts, and topologies</li>
            <li>Developing and testing topologies using Storm's local mode</li>
            <li>Deploying topologies on Storm clusters</li>
            <li>How Storm achieves fault-tolerance and guarantees data processing</li>
            <li>Computing intense functions on the fly in parallel using Distributed RPC</li>
            <li>Making realtime computations idempotent using transactional topologies</li>
            <li>Examples of production usage of Storm</li></ul></p>

                    <p>Storm integrates with any queueing system and any database system. Storm's spout abstraction makes it easy to integrate a new queuing system. Likewise, integrating Storm with database systems is easy.</p>
