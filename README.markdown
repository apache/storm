Master Branch:  
[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/apache/storm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/storm)
[![Maven Version](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.apache.storm/storm-core/badge.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:"org.apache.storm"%20AND%20a:"storm-core")
 
Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, [is used by many companies](http://storm.apache.org/Powered-By.html), and is a lot of fun to use!

The [Rationale page](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Rationale.html) explains what Storm is and why it was built. [This presentation](http://vimeo.com/40972420) is also a good introduction to the project.

Storm has a website at [storm.apache.org](http://storm.apache.org). Follow [@stormprocessor](https://twitter.com/stormprocessor) on Twitter for updates on the project.

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials can be found on the [Storm website](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Home.html).

Developers and contributors should also take a look at our [Developer documentation](DEVELOPER.md).

### Issue tracker
In case you want to raise a bug/feature or propose an idea, please use [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM)

### Which list should I send/subscribe to?
If you are using a pre-built binary distribution of Storm, then chances are you should send questions, comments, storm-related announcements, etc. to [user@storm.apache.org](mailto:user@storm.apache.org).

If you are building storm from source, developing new features, or otherwise hacking storm source code, then [dev@storm.apache.org](mailto:dev@storm.apache.org) is more appropriate.

If you are committers and/or PMCs, or contributors looking for following up and participating development of Storm, then you would want to also subscribe [issues@storm.apache.org](issues@storm.apache.org) in addition to [dev@storm.apache.org](dev@storm.apache.org).

### What will happen with storm-user@googlegroups.com?
All existing messages will remain archived there, and can be accessed/searched [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/storm-user).

New messages sent to storm-user@googlegroups.com will either be rejected/bounced or replied to with a message to direct the email to the appropriate Apache-hosted group.
