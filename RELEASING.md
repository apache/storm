# Release

This document includes information about the Storm release process.

---

# Release Policy

Apache Storm follows the basic idea of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
 3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
 
# Release process

## Preparation

Ensure you can log in to http://repository.apache.org. You should use your Apache ID username and password.

Install an svn client, and ensure you can access the https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/storm/ and https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/storm/ repositories. You should be able to access these with your Apache ID username and password.

Ensure you have a signed GPG key, and that the GPG key is listed in the Storm KEYS file at https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/storm/KEYS. The key should be hooked into the Apache web of trust. You should read the [Apache release signing page](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html), the [release distribution page](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution.html#sigs-and-sums), as well as the [release publishing](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing) and [release policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html) pages.

If you are setting up a new MINOR version release, create a new branch based on `master` branch, e.g. `2.6.x-branch`. Then on master branch, set the version to a higher MINOR version (with SNAPSHOT), e.g. `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.3.0-SNAPSHOT -P dist,rat,externals,examples`.
In this way, you create a new release line and then you can create PATCH version releases from it, e.g. `2.6.0`.

## Setting up a vote

1. Checkout to the branch to be released.

2. Run `mvn release:prepare -P dist,rat,externals,examples` followed `mvn release:perform -P dist,rat,externals,examples`. 
This will create all the artifacts that will eventually be available in maven central. This step may seem simple, 
but a lot can go wrong (mainly flaky tests). Note that this will create and push two commits with the commit message 
starting with "[maven-release-plugin]" and it will also create and publish a git tag, e.g. `v2.6.0`.

3. Once you get a successful maven release, a “staging repository” will be created at http://repository.apache.org 
in the “open” state, meaning it is still writable. You will need to close it, making it read-only. You can find more 
information on this step [here](www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html).

4. Checkout to the git tag that was published by Step 1 above, e.g. `git checkout tags/v2.6.0 -b v2.6.0`. 
Then build it with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`. Run `mvn package` for `storm-dist/binary` and `storm-dist/source` 
to create the actual distributions.

5. Generate checksums for the *.tar.gz and *.zip distribution files, e.g.
```bash
pushd storm-dist/source/target
sha512sum apache-storm-2.6.0-src.zip > apache-storm-2.6.0-src.zip.sha512
sha512sum apache-storm-2.6.0-src.tar.gz > apache-storm-2.6.0-src.tar.gz.sha512
popd

pushd storm-dist/binary/final-package/target
gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-storm-2.6.0.zip > apache-storm-2.6.0.zip.sha512
gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-storm-2.6.0.tar.gz > apache-storm-2.6.0.tar.gz.sha512
popd
```

5. Create a directory in the dist svn repo for the release candidate: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/storm/apache-storm-x.x.x-rcx

6. Run `dev-tools/release_notes.py` for the release version, piping the output to a RELEASE_NOTES.html file. Move that file to the svn release directory, sign it, and generate checksums, e.g.
```bash
python3 dev-tools/release_notes.py 2.6.0 > RELEASE_NOTES.html
gpg --armor --output RELEASE_NOTES.html.asc --detach-sig RELEASE_NOTES.html
sha512sum RELEASE_NOTES.html > RELEASE_NOTES.html.sha512
```

7. Move the release files from Step 4 and 6 to the svn directory from Step 5. Add and commit the files. 
This makes them available in the Apache staging repo.

8. Start the VOTE thread. The vote should follow the [ASF voting process](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html). 
Sample Template sent to dev@storm.apache.org

# How to vote on a release candidate

We encourage everyone to review and vote on a release candidate to make an Apache Storm release more reliable and trustworthy.

Below is a checklist that one could do to review a release candidate. 
Please note this list is not exhaustive and only includes some of the common steps. Feel free to add your own tests.

1. Verify files such as *.asc, *.sha512; some scripts are available under `dev-tools/rc` to help with it;
2. Build Apache Storm source code and run unit tests, create an Apache Storm distribution;
3. Set up a standalone cluster using apache-storm-xxx.zip, apache-storm-xxx.tar.gz, the Apache Storm distribution created from step 2, separately;
4. Launch WordCountTopology and ThroughputVsLatency topology and check logs, UI metrics, etc;
5. Test basic UI functionalities such as jstack, heap dump, deactivate, activate, rebalance, change log level, log search, kill topology;
6. Test basic CLI such as kill, list, deactivate, deactivate, rebalance, etc.

It's also preferable to set up a standalone secure Apache Storm cluster and test basic funcionalities on it.

Don't feel the pressure to do everything listed above. After you finish your review, reply to the corresponding email thread with your vote, summarize the work you have performed and elaborate the issues
you have found if any. Also please feel free to update the checklist if you think anything important is missing there. 

Your contribution is very much appreciated.
